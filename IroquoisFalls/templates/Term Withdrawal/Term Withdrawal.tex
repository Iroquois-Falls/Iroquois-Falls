\noindent\textbf{Initial all that apply:}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{STUDENTS RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID} — I understand that if I withdraw from \textbf{ALL} classes I may owe financial aid back to the university based on federal regulations... I understand that if I am receiving a university scholarship I may lose scholarship eligibility.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS HOLDING F-1 OR J-1 STUDENT VISAS} — I understand that federal regulations require me to obtain authorization for a reduced course load from the International Student and Scholar Services Office (ISSSO) prior to withdrawing from the university and that I have obtained such authorization.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{STUDENT-ATHLETES} — I understand that I must clear any financial holds related to student-athlete services and return all textbooks, uniforms, and equipment to avoid being charged for those items. I must also meet with Student-Athlete Development and the Office of Athletics’ Compliance...
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{VETERANS} — I understand that an official term withdrawal from the university will automatically initiate a recalculation of tuition, fees and the rate of pursuit (enrollment status) reported to the VA. I understand that withdrawing may impact my GI Bill benefits...
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{GRADUATE/PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS} — I understand that any university support (i.e. graduate assignment, DSTF) will be cancelled. Withdrawals after the official reporting day require that I meet with my Academic Advisor and provide instructor-approved drop forms.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{DOCTORAL STUDENTS} — I understand that I must file a leave of absence with the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{STUDENT HOUSING} — I understand that my housing agreement outlines important information regarding housing cancelation and refunds. I understand that I need to check out of my room, complete all check out processes, and return my keys to avoid additional fees.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{DINING SERVICES} — I understand that withdrawing from the university does not automatically relieve me of my obligation to pay outstanding charges stemming from my purchase of a UH Dining Services meal plan. \\
To receive any available credit for the unused portion of my meal plan I must submit a meal plan petition requesting approval for cancellation. Visit \url{http://www.uh.edu/auxiliaryservices/dining/mealpetition.htm}
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\hspace{1.5em}} \textbf{PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION} — I understand that withdrawing from the university does not relieve me of my obligation to pay outstanding charges stemming from my purchase of a UH parking permit or parking citations received. To receive any available credit I understand that I must return the permit to Parking and Transportation Services.
